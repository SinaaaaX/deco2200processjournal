                <p>At week five we already finished our first report and had three different concepts in the medical field. So, we put our concepts and research results together and communicate our key findings. 
				According to Mira`s research she found people tend to rest at home when they get sick rather than go to a medical centre due to long waiting time, second it has been an issue for people who have chronic disease or people who just need to have a good rest and the existing service telehealth has one significant drawback which is lacking physical examination. Therefore she came up with two ideas to solve the main issue, which is the medical delivery drone and autonomous physical examination van.
				And for Tzu-en, she summarised her research results as: 1. People are not willing to go to the hospital. 2. There are lots of reasons that make ambulance late, drones could be much quicker than the ambulance. 3. During the emergency, people tend to be flustered (like forget to call 000, cannot describe condition clearly). And her concept is the emergency drone.
				My research was focusing on the delivery of blood sample and biological specimens, nowadays the transportation of blood is inefficient and expensive. It will be more efficient and safe if the blood can be delivered by a drone whose system can monitor and control the temperature of blood in real time, keep the blood sample in the best conserve condition.

                <p>We choose three concepts to develop storyboards first, which are the medical delivery drone, physical examination van, and emergency rescue drone. Each of us draws one of the storyboards. 
				I draw the medical delivery one, at first my storyboards described a potential user experience, which is a mother whose kid is sick at home, she wants to buy some medicine, however, does not want to leave her child alone, so she uses our medical delivery app and makes an order. Then the drone arrives in a very short time.
				On the tutorial we shown the storyboards to our tutor Christine, she told us we need to add more app interface in the storyboards, she wanted more details about how user interact with the app, therefore we improved our storyboards, made it not only described the situation before and after user use the app but also the user flow. And I also add some new functions like scan the code to unlock the package and rate experience after receiving the product.

                <p>After receiving our grades of assessment 1 we reconsidered all of our concepts. Tzu en`s concepts are emergency drones, it was too hard to contact emergency service and proceed researches. And mine is about blood sample, we have no professional biological background and with the same problem - we got no reply from the hospital, I understand, they are really busy. We also tried divergent thinking and came up with more concepts. For example, in-hospital medication delivery, which is a small automatic car that is mainly responsible for transporting drugs or injections. This may increase efficiency and save time for doctors/ nurses to take things. The other one is mobile infusion stand, it may alleviate problems patients have when they are inconvenient to move (such as going to the toilet).
				Considering our target users are more people in daily life rather than doctors and nurse in the hospital. Besides, we send out several emails as research invitation but still could not get in touch with doctors, which makes later user testing stage difficult to process. Therefore, ideas which are more hospital-based are eliminated.
				Moreover, both emergency supply drones and mobile infusion stand, have very limited functions which do not necessarily require an app to control.
				After the group discussed, we finally decided to develop Mira`s concepts and used them into our further assessments, which are the medical delivery drone and autonomous physical examination van.

                <p>Before we started sketching, Mira named the medical delivery drone and the physical examination van as Medi-Drone and Vannie. And I designed logos for this two apps. I thought a name and the logo is a good start for a project. I searched existing medical apps` logo and decided to contain the symbolic icon - cross. For Medi- Drone I added a little wing on it to present flying drones, and for Vannie, I used thin straight lines to imply streets.

				Then our group spends a whole afternoon to create our low-fidelity prototypes, there are too many details to discuss and confirm. For example, for the payment method choose page, my group member Mira prefer points to select and I prefer to drop down menu. Finally, they agree my opinion because points are too small and drop-down menu can keep interface concise after user choose one method.

				First, after we finished the sketches for Medi-Drone and Vennie, we upload them into POP and test them with students in the university. Our sketches did not contain enough information and clear images, therefore lots of confusions from users are not about the design of the app but about the content.

                <p>We allocated our tasks in detail, I was in charge of developing low-fi prototype and wireframe and they took more responsibility of report. We wanted to test the wireframe as quick as we can, so I firstly focus on the functions of our app, so the first vision is just black and white but include all main screens. 
				I looked through lots of existing medical apps, however as our concept is quite creative and the background is near future, there was not much to reference. But the general style inspired me, I decided to make our app neat and clean, no fancy pictures or font, more focus on functionality and legibility. So, this wireframe got big font and button, if the information is saturated in one page after the user click a button (like choose date) it jumps to a new page instead of shown below.
				We used the wireframe to test about eight participants and got some valuable feedbacks like some users did not understand the meaning of the word "note" in the interface, we need to replace it to a more suitable word. Also, the timetable icon was not obvious enough. And one participant recommended us to add physical examination sets to make the choice of checking components easier. We recorded all of the data and integrated it to report.</p>

							<p>In week ten our procedure turns to final mock-up. My teammates had lots of different opinions with mine, we discussed every detail of interface, colours, measures, icons and layer orders. In order to bring a feeling of clean, reliable and professional, we choose our main colour as the blue-green and use sans serif font with simple icons.
							I referenced the iOS design guidelines, includes all the font size, icon size, button size, and margin and finally ended the argues with the layout. And according to the feedback we received from wireframes, I made some key improvements. Firstly, I combined two make appointment modes together, the only difference is whether the user has the reference number to input, this change reduced the process of making an appointment. Secondly, I added descriptions for steps users may feel confused, like acceptable ID types and checking components. Thirdly, after discussed with Mira, she insisted the reminder before physical examination should be compulsory, I combined My Order page with the reminder, after user completed the payment it will jump directly to My Order page and check the reminder.
							Later, Tzu-en and Mira did some researches about physical examination and provided me professional contents of the reminder and checking components.

							<p>After finishing our final prototype, we went to school and did user testing with classmates, tutors, and strangers. I uploaded the prototype as png format and link each of them in inVision, therefore we can simulate our app in our phones. Mira took her phone and asked people in the tutorial class to try our app, I asked permission to take photos as evidence and Tzu-en recorded their comments. First Mira gave the user a task, usually is make an appointment, with or without reference number (the user flow will have a little difference), then allowed user to explore the app freely. What we did not expect was not every user understand the concept of physical examination van. Some of the participants thought it is similar to Uber, or considered our van has doctors inside to help. This exposed our weakness that we cannot explain our concept efficiently to someone has on idea about in a short time. 
							Before the test, I thought our mock-up is pretty much ready, after all, we already iterated our prototype so many times, from sketches to paper prototype, from low-fi to high-fi and finally the final prototype, we already improved layout and lots of functions. However, for users who did not use prototype like inVision before, they only familiar with existing apps, most of them thought they can click everything on the interface and felt confused when the app needs them to pretend they typed text (like sign up page, they cannot really type their name). But we still received some key feedback, like reference number is not clearly explained on the interface, users have easily clicked the button mistakenly. And users were not clear with what happened after they made the appointment. And for lists, I still used rounded rectangles to list item, one of our participants said they look like buttons, therefore I changed them into split lines to clarify.
							Our last screen is meant to lead the user to confirm their identity by scanning their face in front of van`s door, however, this user flow is out of the app, therefore we added guidance and icons on the interface to present the camera on the van. Also, I added a new page to show the estimated time and van`s current location, which can provide more information to the user.
							At last Tzu-en concluded our evaluations and test results, Mira and I made the video of our app walkthrough.
